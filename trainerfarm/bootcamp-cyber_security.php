Additionally, you can delve into viruses and ransom ware, intrusion detection, useful tools, introduction to embedded (control) systems, secure shell, mobile and endpoint security, virtual machines, malicious code, disaster recovery, and PowerShell. Incident identification and response, as well as technical and legal aspects of forensics, are also covered. By understanding resiliency, automation, and backups, you can gain essential and fundamental protection skills. Lastly, this learning experience will provide you with insight into what a career in cyber security looks like.</p>
